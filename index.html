<p>The Machine Stops is trying to give us a warning message. If people keeping rely on high technology products much, such as phone, laptop and wifi. Our world will become the world that author describe in the story. The fact is people will feel anxiety when they lost their phone or wifi. People are using typing on the laptop more than handwrting on paper, as time goes by people will forgot how to write when they do handwriting stuff. </p>
